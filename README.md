Computing the rank and torsion of x^3+x+1 over \QQ.

Need to compute the j-invariant of the curve over \CC.

Computing the number of points for the (non-elliptic, singular) curve over extensions of F_2.

I will label this integer sequence n_{2,x^3+x+1}.

Can compute the number of points of the elliptic curve over F_7, F_49, i.e. extensions of all degree.

Would like to compute the Zeta function over F_7 to verify the Weil conjectures.

Looking for more information on the curve y^2=x^3+x+1 over the algebraic closure of F_2, \overline{F_2}.
